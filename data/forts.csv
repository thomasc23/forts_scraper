Each firing battery had six mobile launchers with three missiles per launcher. Initially the Battalion Headquarters was located at site HM-82 in Naranja ; Alpha Battery was located at site HM-05 in Goulds ; and Delta Battery was located at site HM-60 (about four miles southwest of Florida City ) (exact site locations all undetermined). Another battery (Bravo or Charlie ?) was initially deployed to Patrick Air Force Base at Cape Canaveral, and another battery (Bravo or Charlie ?) was initially deployed to MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa . The HAWK missiles became fully operational two days before the crisis was diplomatically resolved. In April 1963, Bravo and Charlie Batteries were consolidated with the rest of the battalion at Homestead Air Force Base after the parent 13th Artillery Group was permanently assigned to south Florida and integrated into the continental air defense. Bravo Battery was then located at site HM- ? (unknown location, but most likely south or southeast of Homestead AFB, possibly near HM-39); and Charlie Battery was then located at site HM-80 (unknown location, northwest of Homestead ). Also deployed to Homestead AFB in late October 1962 was Battery B, 1st Gun Battalion, 59th Artillery, which employed the self-propelled 40mm M42 Duster AA gun (a tracked vehicle based on the M41 Walker Bulldog armored tank chassis). This unit stayed in the area until mid December 1962 when they returned to Fort Bliss, Texas. In June 1965 each HAWK firing battery was relocated to newly completed permanent concrete hardstands. The permanent HAWK sites were: Alpha Battery , located on SW 87th Ave. at SW 216th St./Hainlin Mill Rd., south of Franjo and the present Lakes by the Bay community ( HM-12 ). No remains, site now the Mater Academy Cutler Bay campus at 22025 SW 87th Ave..

No remains, site now the Kindercare Learning Center at South Dade at 10190 SW 344th St.. Charlie Battery , located on SW 216th St./Hainlin Mill Dr., west of SW 207th Ave., about seven miles north-northwest of Homestead ( HM-84 ). Partial remains, site now used by the Satin Leaf Nursery tree farm at 20890 SW 210th St..

Partial remains, site now used by the Florida Department of Transportation (FLDOT), 18500 SW 424th St.. The Battalion Headquarters was relocated to Homestead Air Force Base ( HM-98 ); In September 1971 the 8th/15th ADA was replaced by the 3rd/68th ADA. All HAWK missile batteries were deactivated in June 1979. The Army Air Defense Command Post (AADCP) ( HM-01DC ) for both HAWK and NIKE missile defenses (1962 - 1979) was located at the former Richmond Air Force Station on Burr Rd. off of SW 124th Ave.. The 644th Radar Squadron (US Air Force) began operations here in April 1960. Site later became FAA Radar Site J-06, which was destroyed and abandoned after Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The Army's 2nd Battalion, 52nd Air Defense Artillery also deployed to the area in late October 1962 with three batteries of NIKE missiles (the fourth battery, B Battery, did not arrive until sometime later as they were already deployed at the time in the Central Pacific for NIKE missile tests on Johnston Island). The firing batteries became operational on November 14, 1962 (two weeks after the crisis cooled off) at the following temporary field positions: The 13th Artillery Group Headquarters and 2/52nd Battalion Headquarters originally based their operations at Princeton , in the former B&L Farms tomato packing house at SW 244th Street and SW 137th Avenue on the west side of US 1. Battery A was deployed to an area outside of the main entrance to Everglades National Park on the north (or west) side of FL Highway 9336. The launching site was along Canal C-111 (the canal built beginning in 1963) and the administration and IFC areas were approximately one mile north on the same side of the highway. No remains, the location has been returned to farming. Battery C was deployed to Carol City , with the launch site along the Snake Creek Canal between NW 57th Ave./Red Road and NW 47th Ave. (no remains, now a county landfill). The administration and IFC areas were located approximately one mile south near what is now NW 195th Dr. and NW 52nd Ave. (no remains, the site is now the Charles David Wyche Jr. Elementary School). Battery D was deployed to a site somewhere near Perrine (or Cutler Ridge ?), west (?) of US 1 (no remains, now residential and commercial development). Battery B finally arrived in late November or early December 1962, and was deployed to a site ( HM-66 ) about eight miles southwest of Florida City outside of Everglades National Park (exact location undetermined), probably near the future site of the Aerojet solid rocket fuel plant (1965-1986) on SW 232nd Ave./Aerojet Rd. along Canal C-111 (expressly built for the Aerojet plant beginning in 1963). Permanent sites were constructed and operational by June 1965. Nuclear warheads were not installed on the NIKE missiles in Florida until late 1965, but were later removed and replaced with convential warheads in the summer of 1975.

Cuba became a U.S. Protectorate from 1902 to 1934. The present 43-square mile U.S. Naval Reservation was created by treaty in 1903 as an American naval and coaling station (the U.S. Navy also acquired Bahía Honda in the same deal, but that harbor was abandoned in 1911).

Construction was delayed many times by hurricanes, lack of supplies, and the harsh conditions. By 1734 two barracks (one for about 50 soldiers and the other for the laborers), an Officers' quarters, a chapel, a brick cistern, and a brick powder magazine were built, along with several other crude wooden buildings used as quarters for river pilots and transient sailors. A semi-circular supporting battery was erected on Southeast Island in October 1724, about 1200 yards from Balize Island. Extensively repaired in 1741 and 1742 after hurricanes.

They soon abandoned this post due to constant flooding and erosion, and after another storm, moved to the old French site in March 1770, renaming it Fort la Baliza (four guns). A new governor's house was built, along with barracks (20 men), hospital, church, and 10 other structures (the Spanish Governor and his entourage were apparently not popular with the French citizens in the city). The post at Old Balize was destroyed by a hurricane in October 1778, but its ruins still remained visible for many decades thereafter. A new post was then built on Pass a l'Outre (alt. La Lutra ) after 1778, just below its junction with Southeast Pass. It was abandoned in April 1792 due to periodic flooding, and also because it could not control ships which entered Southwest Pass, which was also now being used in addition to Southeast Pass; and that ships entering Southeast Pass had to turn right into Pass a l'Outre to report and then turn back upriver to New Orleans . The government facilities were then transferred to Plaquemine Bend at Fort St. Philip which was then under construction. The Spanish then built a square two-story two-gun log blockhouse and barracks (for 24 men) at the junction of Southeast Pass and Old Balize Bayou in 1794, just upstream from the Old French Balize site. It was briefly captured by French raiders in October 1795, who took away the cannon but did not destroy the blockhouse, which was soon regarrisoned by 20 Spanish soldiers. Taken over by the Americans in December 1803 and possibly repaired, which then became known as Post at Balize . Little was done by the Americans until August 1812, when the British raided the Balize and captured several pilots. A 50-man garrison was then sent, provided with 14 guns of various calibers (six 24-pounders, four 9-pounders, four 6-pounders). The Americans were situated on the north side of Old Balize Bayou slightly east of the last Spanish site, with a new blockhouse, barracks, light tower, and several workshops and pilots' houses.

The British raided Balize again in December 1813, destroying the new battery, and forcing the Americans to evacuate the men and supplies to Fort St. Philip. The new fort was never completed. Balize was re-occupied by the British in December 1814 until after their defeat and withdrawal in January 1815.

The French first built Fort Détour à l'Anglais sometime after December 1722, originally as three earthwork batteries. Substantially rebuilt in 1748 as two nearly identical 30-gun stockaded earthworks (each a 10-gun crescent battery with five four-gun redans) located across the river from each other, one at the river bend just north of Belle Chasse ( Batterie de l'Anse ) and the other opposite on Shingle Point at present-day English Turn ( Batterie de la Pointe ). Each were later rebuilt again in 1754 as four-bastioned squares, renamed Fort St. Leon (19 guns, 70 men) and Fort Ste. Marie (21 guns) respectively. By the mid 1750's these two forts were considered the strongest and most important forts for the downriver defense of New Orleans . Occupied by the Spanish in 1766 but apparently not improved or maintained, both Fort San Leon and Fort Santa Maria were in ruins by 1780, and were officialy abandoned in 1792. Both forts were ordered to be re-occupied in 1794, but were apparently left abandoned. American Fort St. Leon (1808 - 1817) was a ditched earthwork faced with brick, built on (or very close to) the site of the former French Fort St. Leon. Construction began in November 1808, and was completed in March 1810. Garrisoned by only four men in 1811. Built for nine guns, only four were emplaced by December 1814. Its guns could effectively cover the river for about two miles in either direction. Also built were a magazine, two barracks, Officers' quarters, kitchen, and guardhouse. The fort was strengthened in December 1814, which was completed in January 1815, but it was not attacked by the British as they failed to get past Fort St. Philip. An organized encampment with a dozen barracks and six Officers' quarters to house up to 3000 troops was built in December-January 1812-13 across the river at Wood's Ville , immediately upriver from the site of the old French Fort Ste. Marie (the ruins of which were noted at the southwest corner of the encampment area). The barracks were vacated later in 1813, but were re-occupied in September 1814 and fortified with defensive embankments. Both sites were ordered abandoned in 1817. The site of the American Fort St. Leon was found and excavated in 1963 but is now mostly eroded away on the river side of the present-day levee. Approximate site located on Main Street near F.

Substantially rebuilt in 1748 as two nearly identical 30-gun stockaded earthworks (each a 10-gun crescent battery with five four-gun redans) located across the river from each other, one at the river bend just north of Belle Chasse ( Batterie de l'Anse ) and the other opposite on Shingle Point at present-day English Turn ( Batterie de la Pointe ). Each were later rebuilt again in 1754 as four-bastioned squares, renamed Fort St. Leon (19 guns, 70 men) and Fort Ste. Marie (21 guns) respectively. By the mid 1750's these two forts were considered the strongest and most important forts for the downriver defense of New Orleans . Occupied by the Spanish in 1766 but apparently not improved or maintained, both Fort San Leon and Fort Santa Maria were in ruins by 1780, and were officialy abandoned in 1792. Both forts were ordered to be re-occupied in 1794, but were apparently left abandoned. American Fort St. Leon (1808 - 1817) was a ditched earthwork faced with brick, built on (or very close to) the site of the former French Fort St. Leon. Construction began in November 1808, and was completed in March 1810. Garrisoned by only four men in 1811. Built for nine guns, only four were emplaced by December 1814. Its guns could effectively cover the river for about two miles in either direction. Also built were a magazine, two barracks, Officers' quarters, kitchen, and guardhouse. The fort was strengthened in December 1814, which was completed in January 1815, but it was not attacked by the British as they failed to get past Fort St. Philip. An organized encampment with a dozen barracks and six Officers' quarters to house up to 3000 troops was built in December-January 1812-13 across the river at Wood's Ville , immediately upriver from the site of the old French Fort Ste. Marie (the ruins of which were noted at the southwest corner of the encampment area). The barracks were vacated later in 1813, but were re-occupied in September 1814 and fortified with defensive embankments. Both sites were ordered abandoned in 1817. The site of the American Fort St. Leon was found and excavated in 1963 but is now mostly eroded away on the river side of the present-day levee. Approximate site located on Main Street near F. Edward Hebert Blvd.. State marker on the levee just east from Hebert Blvd.. Violet , according to one published source. --> Union Camp Kenyon (February-March 1864) was located on the east bank at or near the ruins of Fort Ste. Marie.

Camp Carrollton (a) (October 1861 - February 1862), also known as Camp Roman , located in the Carrollton area on the Roman Plantation. The same site, or nearby land, was later used by Union troops ( Camp Carrollton (b) ) after the fall of the city (May 1862). Camp Romain (December 1861), likely a mis-spelling of Camp Roman. Barataria / Company Canal Defense Line , defensive earthworks for artillery, with two bastions, built on the west (south) bank of the Mississippi River in the present-day Westwego area along the south bank of the Barataria (or Company) Canal to Bayou Segnette (present-day Laroussini Street / Sala Ave., past 4th Street to 5th or 6th Streets).

This defense line was retained and maintained by the Union until the end of the war, and possibly later. Camp Walker (April-May 1861), a training camp at the Metairie horse race track (present-day Metairie Cemetery) on the north side of Metairie Road. Initially named Camp Metairie and then Camp Smith (1) during its first week. It was soon replaced by Camp Moore in Tangipahoa (see page three) over health concerns due to overcrowding (with well over 3000 troops). Defensive fortifications nearby were a gun battery located along Canal Street at the New Canal Shell Road (present-day Pontchartrain Blvd.), and a two-gun battery at the Jefferson and Lake Pontchartrain Railroad (aka Carrollton Railroad) (at present-day Maryland Drive and Bordeaux or Dahlia Streets at the 17th Street Canal).

Washington Square (1861 - 1862), a public square used as a Confederate troop campsite, and later also by Union troops. Chalmette Defense Line , defensive earthworks built on the east (north) bank of the Mississippi River in the Chalmette area, about 700 yards below the old 1815 Jackson defense line, now just below the downriver brick wall of the cemetery. Some trace remnants still remain. This helped protect the Mexican Gulf Railroad. River batteries (12 guns) here briefly engaged the Union fleet in April 1862. Camp Chalmette (2) (November 1861 - April 1862), in Chalmette at the old 1815 Battleground. Also used later by various Union troops (1862 - May 1865). Camp Carondelet (1) (December 1861), in Chalmette at the old 1815 Battleground. McGehee Defense Line , defensive earthworks built on the west (south) bank of the Mississippi River on the McGehee Plantation, in the present-day Aurora Gardens area of Algiers , directly across from Chalmette . The works were about three-fourths of a mile long from the levee to the swamp. River batteries (six guns) here briefly engaged the Union fleet in April 1862. Trace remnants still exist.
