It is believed that these Indians most likely built the pueblo at that time, although it is known that a group of Taos Indians had previously arrived here in 1664 and lived here for about 15 years with the Plains Apache before Spanish troops returned them to New Mexico.  The pueblo was abandoned after 1706, but was occassionally used by Spanish troops or French traders as a temporary frontier outpost until the 1730's.  The ruins were not known to Anglo-American pioneers.  The ruins were rediscovered in 1889, confirmed in 1898, and later became part of Lake Scott State Park in the 1960's.  The

3902,3449,1812,1823,,,0,"Pembina was established in 1801 by Thomas Miller and eight Orkney men who arrived from Albany Fort in Ontario.  It was first located at the mouth of the Pembina River on the east side of the Red River.  The North West Company operated a post nearby until 1810.  During the winter of 1812-1813, Pembina was home to some of the first Red River settlers, who did not have enough provisions at their new settlement.  Fort Daer, or Colony Fort, was erected nearby and became a regular wintering spot for Red River settlers.  Between 1813 and 1817, Pembina was not in operation.  In 1823 Pembina was abandoned since surveys proved that the post lay south of the 49th parallel boundary line.  In September 1845 Pembina was re-established by John Palmer Bourke.  In 1895 it was permanently abandoned.
